* Piano
I am not a professional piano player but I love to create some piano vedios to pay tribute to my favorite songs including J-pop and theme songs in animation.
You can find my WeChat vedio account through this QR code

* Yorushika
I am a fan of [Yorushika](https://yorushika.com/)（J-pop rock duo）A band formed by composer "n-buna" and vocalist "suis".They are known for their juxtaposition of "passionate" and "upbeat" production and instrumentation fused with heavier lyrical content, which often explore ideas such as love and human emotion and draw from works of literature including Masuji Ibuse and Jules Verne. I will update more Yorushika song adapted paino vedios in my account whenever I have time.
