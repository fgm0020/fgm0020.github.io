Hello this is Gavin Fang's personal webpage. I am currently an undergraduate student of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and major in Chemistry. This is a simple webpage which includes my publication, Interest, Research Interest and CV. Thank you for your time to click this webpage and get to know me. I will work hard and keep updating this webpage if I make progress.
